    <p class="page_copy">
        The School Culture and Climate Initiative (Initiative) was created in order to help improve school culture and climate while also promoting the health and wellness of staff and students in grades pre-K to 12.  Co-founders, Liz Warner and Patricia Heindel, Ph.D., well-respected thought leaders in the field of social and emotional learning and school climate, began by asking a seemingly simple question, “What do students need in order to thrive?”  That initial inquiry coupled with best practices and research from the fields of school climate, social-emotional learning and character development, led to the conclusion that schools should be inspiring, challenging, and respectful places where all individuals feel safe and supported.

        Many schools already had programs and curricula in place to support students but needed assistance with infusing social-emotional learning into classroom lessons and creating cohesion so that existing programs were streamlined and changes could be addressed systemically throughout all aspects of school life and sustained over time.  The Initiative rose to the challenge and began building a comprehensive support system to help cultivate thriving schools.  Schools working with the Initiative experienced success in transforming their learning environments and it didn’t take long for this energy and excitement to become contagious. Subsequently, the Initiative grew as did their services and their reach within the United States.  Today, the Initiative is recognized nationally as a model that brings about sustainable change in schools and positively impacts the lives of students and their families.
